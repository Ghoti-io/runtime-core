# Fail if a public header carries no stability label, or the wrong one.
#
# AD-14: every public header says whether it is `stable` (frozen at the major
# version once released) or `free` (a consumer requires the exact version it
# was built against). The label is a Doxygen tag in the header's @file block:
#
#     @stability stable
#
# Which one is not a free choice: this library's layout fixes it by directory.
# The top level (shared basics) and b/ (the execution context) are stable; a/
# (the frame protocol) is free. A free header in b/ would quietly promise less
# than the spine says, and a stable header in a/ would freeze the A<->B
# interface before it has been used.
#
# Usage: check-labels.sh <root>
#   <root> holds include/ghoti.io/runtime-core/. The self-test runs this same
#   script against tests/gates fixtures.
#
# Fails on an empty population: no headers found means the gate measured
# nothing, and a gate that measures nothing reports success.
